# ApiRTC on Ionic
This tutorial explains you how to use apiRTC and to build an application for iOS.

First of all you need to install Ionic. Please follow [this link](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) to get started with ionic

To build this example, you first need to add a target platform and a few plugins
```
git clone https://github.com/apizee/ApiRTC-ionic.git
cd ApiRTC-ionic
npm install xcode
ionic build
ionic cordova platform remove ios
chmod +x plugins/cordova-plugin-iosrtc/extra/hooks/iosrtc-swift-support.js
ionic cordova platform add ios
```

Then, run an emulator like this :
```
ionic cordova build ios
ionic cordova run ios

```

Open [this link](https://apirtc.com/tutos/Mobile/index.html) with Chrome to exchange with your mobile over webrtc

## Requirements

In order to make this application run into a iOS application some requirements must be satisfied in both development computer and target devices:

* Xcode >= 7.2.1
* iOS >= 9 (run on lower versions at your own risk, but don't report issues)
* `cordova-ios` 4.X

## ApiRTC key
For this demo we use the Api key "myDemoApiKey". Please register on [our website](https://apirtc.com/get-key/) to get your private api key.

## Building errors on iOS
To avoid errors, we use the plugin cordova-custom-config to integrate all Xcode configuration. But you can find solutions here:

**Build error**

Swift is unavailable on iOS versions under 7.0. Please set IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 7.0 or later (currently it is ‘6.0’).

**Solution**

Click on your project files tree in XCode on HelloCordova
Go to Build Settings, look under Deployment Info, change iOS Deployment Target to 7.0


**Build error**

"Use of undeclared identifier” and “Use of undeclared type"

**Solution**

Go to Build Settings, look under “Swift Compiler – Code Generation” (near the bottom), edit the setting “Objective-C Bridging Header” and enter ../../plugins/cordova-plugin-iosrtc/src/cordova-plugin-iosrtc-Bridging-Header.h in debug and release


**Build error** 

You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture arm64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

**Solution**

Go to Build Settings, Build Option, edit the setting “Enable bitcode” to “NO”


**Runtime error**

Thread 1: EXC_BREAKPOINT (code=EXC_ARM_BREAKPOINT, subcode=0xe7ffdefe)” Meanwhile, the output console shows: dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/XX/WebRTCSample.app/WebRTCSample Reason: image not found

**Solution**

Go to Build Settings, look under Linking, edit “Runpath Search Paths”, and add the path @executable_path/Frameworks in debug and release

## Building errors on Android
**Add the following permissions to the Android manifest **:(<nameOfYourProject>/platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml).
<uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO” />
<uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.CAMERA” />
<uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS” />

## Optional tips

The crosswalk plugin is not necessary for Android 5.0+ as WebRTC is now supported in native WebView. It may enable you to have lightweight application but you will loose compatibility with Android version less than 5.0

The following steps will convert the project to use Android 5.0+ native WebView.

-If crosswalk plugin is already added, remove it with Terminal command :
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
-In AndroidManifest.xml, set the minSdkVersion to 21.
-A patch may be needed in Cordova to allow WebRTC getUserMedia. Refer to pull request https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/178/files to make changes to the file /platforms/android/CordovaLib/src/org/apache/cordova/engine/SystemWebChromeClient.java.

## Try your project

In order to test, open [this link](https://cloud.apizee.com/apiRTC/Samples/apiPhone-level2.html) on your computer browser:

You will be able to establish a webRTC call between your app and your computer using the number that has been automatically assigned to your apiRTC Client.
